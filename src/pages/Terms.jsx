          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of
            IMY HOLDING INVESTMENTS’ services, website, and other digital
            platforms. By engaging with IMY’s services or using our website, you
            agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, refrain from
            using our services or website. Any specific contract you sign with
            IMY for particular services will incorporate these Terms by
            reference, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMY HOLDING INVESTMENTS ("IMY," "we," or "us") is a company
            registered in London, United Kingdom. We operate internationally
            across Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East. Our
            contact information is provided in our Privacy Policy and on our
            website. When you engage IMY, you are doing business with a UK‑based
            entity subject to English law (see Section 9).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Services</h2>
          <p>
            IMY provides professional services including branding, digital
            marketing, web development, influencer campaign management, and
            related consulting. Scope, deliverables, timelines, and pricing are
            defined in individual contracts or proposals. While we deliver
            services professionally and per specifications, results can vary and
            are influenced by many factors; we do not guarantee specific
            outcomes unless expressly stated in a contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Changes to Scope:</strong> Additional services or scope
            changes after contract signature must be documented (e.g., change
            order or amendment) and may involve additional fees. We proceed with
            out‑of‑scope work only after approval of the new terms.

            3. Client Responsibilities
          </h2>
          <p>Clients agree to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Provide Timely & Accurate Information:</strong> supply
              materials, data, and feedback needed; delays on the client side
              may affect timelines. IMY is not liable for delays caused by
              client inaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Respect Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> use IMY
              deliverables only as authorised or set out in your contract. You
              must have necessary rights for materials you provide and indemnify
              IMY for third‑party claims arising from your provided materials
              that infringe others’ rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Comply with Laws & Regulations:</strong> ensure your
              requests and use of our services comply with applicable laws
              (e.g., advertising standards, privacy laws, anti‑spam rules,
              sector‑specific regulations). IMY is not responsible for
              consequences of unlawful materials or instructions provided by the
              client.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Failure to meet obligations may limit our ability to deliver, cause
            delays, or incur additional costs. Serious breaches (e.g., requests
            to engage in illegal activities) may entitle IMY to suspend or
            terminate services (see Section 7).

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Fees & Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Fees are set out in a separate contract, proposal, or service
            agreement. By signing or formally agreeing, you commit to pay as
            described.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Currency & Schedule:</strong> payments in the currency
              specified (typically GBP) and within the timeframe indicated
              (e.g., 14 or 30 days from invoice date), as per your contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment Method:</strong> as stated in our invoice/contract
              (e.g., bank transfer, credit card). Related transfer/processing
              fees may be the client’s responsibility unless agreed otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Late or Missed Payments:</strong> if payment is not
              received by due date, IMY may suspend work or access to
              deliverables until accounts are current. Significant
              delay/non‑payment may lead to termination (see Section 7) and
              legal recovery. We may charge interest on late payments per
              applicable laws or contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Set‑off:</strong> payments must be made in full without
              deduction or withholding, and you agree not to set off amounts due
              to IMY against claims you may have (unless required by law).

            5. Intellectual Property
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all intellectual property rights
            in work products, content, designs, strategies, software code, or
            other materials created by IMY during delivery remain the property
            of IMY HOLDING INVESTMENTS. This includes rights in graphic designs,
            copy, audio/visual productions, methodologies, and proprietary
            techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Client Licence:</strong> you receive a licence to use the
            deliverables produced for you solely for the purposes and scope
            outlined in our agreement. You may not resell, sublicense, or
            repurpose outside the agreed scope. If a transfer of IP ownership is
            desired (e.g., full ownership of a logo or software), it must be
            expressly agreed and may involve additional fees/terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pre‑Existing IP:</strong> each party’s pre‑existing IP
            remains with that party. Each grants the other a limited licence to
            use such materials only to fulfil the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third‑Party Materials:</strong> where we use third‑party
            materials (e.g., stock images, open‑source libraries), we will
            secure appropriate licences and pass on necessary rights for your
            use within the deliverable, and inform you of key third‑party
            licence terms.

            6. Warranties & Liability
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Indirect/Consequential Loss:</strong> IMY is not liable
              for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (e.g.,
              lost profits, revenue, opportunity, data, goodwill), even if
              advised of the possibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third‑Party Platforms/Events:</strong> we are not liable
              for issues beyond our control (e.g., social platform
              changes/outages, account suspensions, hosting downtime, changes in
              law, force majeure events) impacting performance. We will make
              reasonable efforts to adapt projects when such events occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Results Not Guaranteed:</strong> marketing outcomes vary;
              targets/forecasts are estimates, not promises.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monetary Cap:</strong> IMY’s total liability for claims
              relating to services or these Terms is limited to the total amount
              you paid us for the specific service or project in question,
              whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict
              liability, or otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Limitation for Certain Liability:</strong> we do not
              exclude or limit liability where unlawful to do so, including for
              death/personal injury due to negligence, fraud/fraudulent
              misrepresentation, or other non‑excludable liabilities.

            7. Suspension & Termination
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>By Agreement or Notice:</strong> either party may
              terminate for convenience if permitted by the contract (typical
              notice periods/formalities apply—e.g., 30 days’ written notice).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For Breach:</strong> if a party materially breaches and
              fails to remedy within a reasonable period after notice (where
              remediable), the other party may terminate immediately.
              Non‑payment after a grace period may lead to termination by IMY;
              similarly, your right to terminate applies if IMY breaches a
              fundamental obligation and fails to remedy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Suspension:</strong> IMY may suspend services without
              terminating if payments are overdue or continuation would violate
              law/regulation. We will notify you and work in good faith to
              resolve issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> IMY will stop work and
              invoice for work completed up to termination. Licences to
              deliverables may end depending on contract terms (e.g., unpaid
              deliverables must cease to be used). We will return/destroy your
              confidential materials on request, except for archival/legal
              compliance. Sections that by nature survive (IP, confidentiality,
              liability, and governing law) continue after termination.

              legal compliance (e.g., advertising disclosures, privacy
              requirements, promotional restrictions). Inform us of local rules
              relevant to your campaign and ensure your own compliance.

              your country if deemed applicable by a competent authority.

              social accounts, collaborating with overseas influencers).
              Personal data is handled per our Privacy Policy and applicable

          </h2>
          <p>
            These Terms and any contract between you and IMY are governed by the
            laws of England and Wales. The parties submit to the exclusive
            jurisdiction of the courts of England, with the courts of London as
            the primary venue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>EU-based Consumers:</strong> if you are an individual in the
            EU engaging services for personal (non‑business) use, mandatory
            rights under your local law may allow claims in your home courts.
            Nothing here affects such mandatory rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Severability & Waiver:</strong> if any provision is held
            unenforceable/invalid, it will be limited or eliminated to the
            minimum extent necessary; the remainder remains in full force. Our
            failure to enforce any right or provision is not a waiver.
