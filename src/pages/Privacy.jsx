            3. How We Use Your Data
          </h2>
          <p>We use personal data for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Service Delivery:</strong> to deliver, personalise, and
              manage our services (branding projects, digital marketing
              campaigns, web development, and influencer campaigns you engage us
              for).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communication:</strong> to communicate with you regarding
              our services, including newsletters, responses to enquiries,
              proposals, and updates on ongoing campaigns or projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance Analysis and Improvement:</strong> to analyse
              campaign performance, user engagement, and website traffic so we
              can improve our services and marketing strategies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong> to comply with
              our legal obligations (e.g., financial record‑keeping), detect
              fraud, ensure security, or enforce agreements.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal bases:</strong> consent (e.g., marketing emails),
            performance of a contract (to fulfil services), legitimate interests
            (e.g., improving our services or securing our platform, balanced
            against your rights), and legal compliance. We will only use your
            data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we
            reasonably consider it compatible with the original purpose. If we
            need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
            notify you and explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Data Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            We respect your privacy and do not sell your personal information.
            We may share your data with:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Internal Team:</strong> relevant IMY personnel on a
              need‑to‑know basis and subject to confidentiality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trusted Service Providers:</strong> third‑party processors
              (e.g., cloud hosting such as Google Cloud Platform, CRM tools,
              analytics services, payment processors) bound by strict data
              protection terms and security standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Partners:</strong> where needed to deliver
              influencer campaigns or co‑branded projects (e.g., influencers,
              talent agencies, media platforms) strictly for the specified
              purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal and Regulatory:</strong> governmental agencies,
              regulators, or authorities if required by law (e.g., court order).
              We may also share information to establish or exercise legal
              rights, defend against legal claims, investigate suspected illegal
              activities or fraud, or protect safety.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> because we operate
              internationally and use cloud services, your data may be
              transferred outside the UK or EEA. We will implement appropriate
              safeguards (e.g., UK/EU Standard Contractual Clauses and other
              lawful mechanisms) to ensure an equivalent level of protection.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We remain responsible for personal data we collect and will ensure
            any third party provides an adequate level of protection in line
            with this Policy and applicable law. Questions about service
            providers or international transfers can be sent using the contact
            details at the end of this Policy.

              <strong>Marketing and Analytics Data:</strong> retained for up to
